# ECSManager.js & ECS.integration.test.js: Missing Test Considerations

## 1. Entity-Related
- **Entity Creation with Duplicate Names:**  
  Test if creating multiple entities with the same name causes any issues or unexpected behavior.
- **Entity Creation with Falsy/Empty Name:**  
  Test creating an entity with `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string as the name.
- **Entity Destruction Edge Cases:**  
  - Destroying an entity twice.
  - Destroying an entity that never existed.
- **Entity Existence Check with Falsy/Invalid IDs:**  
  Test `hasEntity` with `null`, `undefined`, empty string, or non-string values.

## 2. Component-Related
- **Add Component to Non-existent Entity:**  
  Already tested, but could add more cases for invalid types/data.
- **Remove Component from Non-existent Entity:**  
  Already tested, but could add more cases for invalid types.
- **Add Duplicate Component Type to Entity:**  
  What happens if you add the same component type twice to an entity?
- **Remove Component Not Present on Entity:**  
  What happens if you try to remove a component type that isn't present?

## 3. System-Related
- **Register System with Duplicate Name:**  
  What happens if you register two systems with the same name?
- **Enable/Disable System with Falsy/Invalid Name:**  
  Test with `null`, `undefined`, empty string, or non-string values.
- **Register System Without Update Method:**  
  Already tested, but could add more cases for other missing/invalid properties.

## 4. Event-Related
- **Event Emission for All Lifecycle Events:**  
  Ensure all expected events are emitted (entity/component/system add/remove, etc.).
- **Event Listeners with Edge Cases:**  
  Add/remove listeners for non-existent events, or with invalid handlers.

## 5. Debug/Stats
- **Debug Info Consistency:**  
  After a series of entity/component/system operations, is the debug info accurate?
- **Stats After Bulk Operations:**  
  Create/destroy many entities/components/systems and check stats.

## 6. Performance/Concurrency
- **Rapid Entity Creation/Destruction:**  
  Stress test with rapid creation and destruction of entities.
- **Concurrent Modifications:**  
  Simulate modifications during system updates (may require async or mock timing).
